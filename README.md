# GifTastic

###  you'll use the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of your choice. 
###  my theme is fruitBusket. But you can simply search any funny gif animate picture you want.

###  I used Giphy API and Ajax to retrieve data from Giphy website, and jQuery to generate the button and display the gif pictures.

###  One more thing to be fixed due to the time limit, is the rating of picture and the picture could not keep in one column, which makes the layout looks a bit ugly. I will fix it later.

## And the applicatoin I made goes here().
